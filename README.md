# PRCP-1001-RiceLeaf_Disease_Detection-CNN

## Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

Task3:- Analyze various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc and create a report on that.


## Dataset Link:
This dataset contains 120 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class.
Classes
●	Leaf smut
●	Brown spot
●	Bacterial leaf blight

## Model Comparison Report

Create a report stating the performance of multiple models on this data and suggest the best model for production.

## Report on Challenges faced

Create a report which should include challenges you faced on data and what technique used with proper reason.


**Note:-All above tasks have to be done on a single jupyter notebook and share the same for final submission of the project.**
